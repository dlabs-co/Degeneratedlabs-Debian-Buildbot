Degeneratedlabs build system
----------------------------

This is an automated build system based on qemu images (thanks to aurel32,
Aur√©lien Jarno for the images) for Degeneratedlabs's Live Cds and for
aircrack-ng unoficial packages currently keep at http://repo.degeneratedlabs.net

How to use it
-------------

You usually don't need to, we do it for you, building weekly images that are shared via
bittorrent (seed us! [0])

But, if you want to do it anyway, this is intended to be almost automated.
You just download this repo, execute build_system_builder.sh (wich will prompt you to
copypaste some stuff on the debian images) and wait.
For custom builds you'd have to adjust the urls to point to your own repo (fork us!)

All the needed changes are made in the repo, not the build system (as it has to be)
